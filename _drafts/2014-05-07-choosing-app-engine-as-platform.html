<h2>A 5-step program</h2><div style="text-align: justify;">I was pushed into App Engine by my <a href="http://www.revevol.eu/">current company</a>. For me, entering the App Engine world went that way :</div><br /><ol><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Be amazed</b> : you can deploy an application in production without all the hassle of setting up a tomcat server, write a deployment script (or deploy by hand) etc... It's as simple as clicking on a button in Eclipse. </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Get annoyed</b> : when you notice the most importants limitations that Google put in place in App Engine. More specifically, the annoyance usually comes with the 1 minute limitation that Google puts on every HTTP request (on frontend servers only) </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Start to understand</b> : those limitations are actually strong incentives to adapt your design. After all, who wants their user to wait more than 1 minute behind the scene ? </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Be amazed, phase 2</b> : enjoy App Engine specific APIs. App Engine provides you with a great set of help tools for things such as push notifications (Channel API), almost seamless NoSQL-to-POJO mapping (Objectify), java.io.file-like API to long-term storage (Cloud Storage) etc.. </li><li style="text-align: justify;"><b>Accept your fate</b> : you're doomed to like App Engine, really. Anyway, now that you have developped all your applications on it, you kind of have to (see below). You noticed a few downsides (poor maven integration but it's improving really fast), but overall, you're happy with the platform.</li></ol><h2>So that's still a great tool ?</h2><div style="text-align: justify;">It is ! The Google Engineers put a great effort in improving the tool by adding more features and making it more reliable. My company bought a premium plan so we have a 24/7 support, which is nothing like the other support teams you might have met. Those guys seem eager to help, have a very deep understanding of how the platform works, and have almost direct access to the teams in charge of product development, for more advanced questions.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Really, Google Cloud Platform support teams, good work !</div><h2>OK I'll migrate all my apps tomorrow !</h2><div>Wow, not so fast.</div><pre class="brush: java;">&lt;test&gt;<br />&lt;/test&gt;</pre>
