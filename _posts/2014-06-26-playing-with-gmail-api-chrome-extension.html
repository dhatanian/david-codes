Google announced yesterday their <a href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/">GMail
    API</a>. With this API, you can access the user's emails, drafts, attachments etc, as always under OAuth access control.
<br/>
<br/>I've written a small demo of a Chrome extension that converts your emails to PDF, and creates a new draft with the PDF in attachment. It uses the
<i>chrome.identity</i>&nbsp;api to retrieve the OAuth token.<br/>
<br/>It is an alpha version, with a lot of bugs. I need to improve the reading of the mails and the parsing of the gmail URL, as well as the global look. But it is still satisfying.
<br/><br/>Here's a video of the extension in action.<br/>
