<div style="text-align: justify;">I always regarded the insurance packages provided with credit cards or flight tickets
    as pure scams that nobody would ever get to work.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">However I own a Visa Premier debit card since it was the cheapest my bank was offering
    at the time, and I was forced to use their medical assistance service once.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">While I eventually got reimbursed, the whole process took so much time, patience, and
    resistance to incompetence that I feel the need to write it down somewhere.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">At least in France, Visa Premier's medical assistance service is handled by Europe
    Assistance. If you are a customer of Europe Assistance or the owner of a Visa card, this is a warning. I hope you
    will not experience the same service as I did. If by any chance someone at Europe Assistance stumbles on this post,
    please do something to improve your customer service. You are dealing with people who need help (your company name
    should be a hint) and you cannot have such a subpar communication process.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Agents do not read the text of filed
    requests</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Getting reimbursed for my fiancée's medical expenses took us 46 days, during which I
    had several contacts over email and phone with Europe Assistance's agents.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">All of them were very polite, but of a limited professionalism. While I understand
    that on the phone agents do not have the time to review all the information of a ticket, it should be obvious that
    when they're using asynchronous communication such as emails they should check the request history first.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In our case, it was clear that the agents did not bother to check first. While most of
    the people they deal with is under French healthcare, it is not my fiancée's case. I had to explain this several
    times to agents who expected me to produce a proof of reimbursement from the French healthcare. Almost every of my
    early interactions started with "you need to provide a proof of reimbursement", and then I had to explain that it
    was neither possible nor required.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The same thing happened with the documents that we were asked to submit, namely a copy
    of our plane ticket and a copy of my &nbsp;fiancée's passport. I sent both and then called to check that they were
    received. And the conversation goes :
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent - Yes we received you plane ticket, we will start the verification process.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Me - OK... wait, you have received the plane ticket AND the passport right ?</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent - No only the plane ticket, you need to re-send the passport</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Tell me Europe Assistance, how hard is it to show on your agents' computer a small box
    explaining what is the next step and what is expected from the customer ?
</div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Europe assistance does not understand what asynchronous communication means</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I mentioned later that I emailed them, then called them. That's how you must work with
    them.&nbsp;<span style="text-align: justify;">Remember 1995 when you called your mom to tell her to check her emails ? Europe Assistance is blocked on this year...</span>
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">There is absolutely no way to confirm that the email was received... in 2014 it seems
    unbelievable to me that their ticketing system does not automatically confirm that the email was received, but even
    worst : I sent more than 10 emails ending with something like "please acknowledge reception of this mail". I know
    that the emails arrived, because I received an answer a few days later, but never, not only once, did an agent
    bother to reply a one-liner such as "thank you for your message, we will process it in the next few days".
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Seriously, when you use asynchronous communication, please provide peace of mind to
    your customers by acknowledging their messages.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">You might wonder why I am so fixated on getting my emails acknowledged, but here's the
    reason...
</div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">Emails with big attachments are "lost"</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Europe Assistance's mail servers have a ridiculous limit on attachment size. I do not
    remember the exact limit but nothing more than a couple megabytes could be sent. When you know that they ask for the
    full copy of a passport (yes, all pages, including the empty ones), imagine the consequences. I had to send 40
    mails, one per page, to make sure everything reaches this seemingly impermeable wall.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">All email services impose a limit on attachment size, but it is customary when an
    email is too big to warn the sender by replying with a warning.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Europe Assistance seems to have never heard of this common sense solution. They simply
    drop the email in some black hole, and nobody ever hears of it, until you call them only to learn that they never
    received it.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">How is that decent customer service ? How hard would it be to assist the user into
    sending his documents to their services ? I am a software engineer and when something does not work (like an email
    that never reaches its destination) I can guess the reason and it is easy enough for me to resize an image, but is
    it the case for all their audience ?
</div><h2 style="text-align: justify;">They do not push the process forward, you have to call them for that</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This really drives me crazy. Their support system is here for one thing and one thing
    only : follow the process that they themselves defined.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">During my phone exchanges with their agents, it happened twice that the process was
    stalled for no apparent reason.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Me - "We have completed the process, sent all the documents, but we are still waiting
    for the payment"
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent - "Ah yes your request is here, let me process it and get back to you"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Wait, we have been waiting for two weeks while our request was just sitting on your
    (virtual) desk and you were not processing it ? What if I hadn't called ?
</div><h2>They are unable to process a complaint</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">At some point, I complained on twitter, curious to know if there would be a response,
    not hoping much from a company that still does not master email.
</div>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr">Europe Assistance really needs to improve their support process !

<br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="fr"><a href="https://twitter.com/DHatanian">@DHatanian</a> Could you send us
    your phone number by DM ? Our assistance team will call you back. Thank you<br/>— Europ Assistance FR (@EA_FRA) <a

<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <script async="" charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
    After some complications because their community manager does not know that he needs to follow someone so that the
    person can DM, I explained my issue, hoping that it would get escalated and that things would get smoother.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br/></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I then got the dreaded answer "I checked your file, and you just need to provide the
    reimbursement proof from the French healthcare service". Aaaah thank you so much Europ Assistance, I see that you
    reviewed my situation carefully, especially my messages explaining that my fiancée was not registered under French
    healthcare.
</div><h2>I will never sign up for Europe Assistance again</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I am lucky that my credit card's assurance was provided by Europe Assistance, because
    now I know that I will never decide to use their services for me or anyone who is dear to me. I seriously hope that
    they will improve their service, because my experience with them did not look professional at all.
